# Microphone Sound Sensor Module

#### Project Overview

This project utilizes a microphone sound sensor module connected to an Arduino Nano to detect sound levels. The sensor module converts sound intensity into an analog voltage, which is read by the Arduino Nano. When the sound level exceeds a certain threshold, it triggers an action, such as turning on an LED or sending a signal.

#### Components Needed

- **Arduino Nano**
- **Microphone Sound Sensor Module**
- **Jumper Wires**

#### Block diagram


#### Circuit Setup

1. **Connect Microphone Sound Sensor Module to Arduino Nano:**
   - **Analog Output Pin:** Connect to analog pin A0 on Arduino Nano.
   - **VCC:** Connect to 5V on Arduino Nano.
   - **GND:** Connect to GND on Arduino Nano.

#### Instructions

1. **Circuit Setup:**
   - Connect the microphone sound sensor module to the Arduino Nano as described in the circuit setup section.

2. **Code Upload:**
   - Open the Arduino IDE and create a new sketch.
   - Copy and paste the provided Arduino code into the sketch.

3. **Testing:**
   - Upload the code to the Arduino Nano.
   - Open the serial monitor with a baud rate of 9600.
   - Observe the serial monitor output. When sound is detected above the threshold (sensor value > 500), it should print "Sound Detected!".

#### Applications

- **Sound Detection:** Use for applications where detecting sound levels is necessary, such as for triggering alarms, monitoring noise levels, or sound-based interactive projects.
- **Environment Monitoring:** Implement in projects requiring monitoring of ambient noise levels.
- **Home Automation:** Useful for integrating sound-based control into home automation systems.

#### Notes

- Ensure the sensor module is correctly connected to the Arduino Nano and powered.
- Adjust the threshold value (`sensorValue > 500`) in the code to suit your specific sound level detection requirements.
- Consider adding additional features or components based on your project needs.
